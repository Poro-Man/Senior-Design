# 🧠 Chapter 6.1 — Different Categories of Finetuning

## Overview
Chapter **6.1** of *Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)* introduces the two major approaches to **finetuning** a pretrained LLM after pretraining on a large text dataset:

1. **Instruction-Finetuning**
2. **Classification-Finetuning**

These approaches represent the primary ways to adapt a general-purpose language model for specific downstream tasks:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

## 1️⃣ Instruction-Finetuning
Instruction-finetuning focuses on **teaching a model to follow natural language instructions**.  
It uses datasets composed of **instruction–response pairs**, where each entry tells the model what to do and how to respond.

**Purpose:**  
To improve the model’s ability to interpret and execute varied, natural-language prompts.

**Example tasks (as in Figure 6.2):**
- Determining whether a text is spam.
- Translating English sentences into German.

**Characteristics:**
- Enables generalization across many task types.  
- Requires large, diverse datasets.  
- More computationally intensive but results in a flexible, instruction-following model:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## 2️⃣ Classification-Finetuning
Classification-finetuning adapts a pretrained LLM to perform **structured prediction tasks** where data must be categorized into predefined classes.

**Purpose:**  
To enable the model to recognize and classify input text efficiently.

**Example tasks:**
- Spam vs. non-spam message detection.  
- Sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral).

**Characteristics:**
- Task-specific and less data-hungry.  
- Easier and faster to train compared to instruction-finetuning.  
- Produces models specialized for a limited set of categories.

## ⚖️ Choosing Between the Two
| Aspect | Instruction-Finetuning | Classification-Finetuning |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Goal** | General instruction-following | Specific task classification |
| **Flexibility** | High (many task types) | Low (fixed categories) |
| **Data Requirement** | Large & varied | Small & focused |
| **Computation** | Expensive | Lightweight |
| **Best for** | Chatbots, assistants, translators | Spam filters, sentiment analysis |

> ✏️ *Instruction-finetuning builds adaptability; classification-finetuning builds specialization.*

## 🧩 Chapter Context
Figure **6.1** places these finetuning strategies in the broader LLM development pipeline:

![Figure 6.1 — Stages of LLM Development](swappy-20251015-091804.png)

1. **Pretraining** on a large general corpus.  
2. **Finetuning** for specific applications — either through classification or instruction-based adaptation:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

Chapter 6 continues with a hands-on implementation of **classification-finetuning**, while the next chapter (7) focuses entirely on **instruction-finetuning**.

**Summary:**  
> Chapter 6.1 distinguishes the two primary finetuning strategies for LLMs.  
> Instruction-finetuning enhances general language understanding and task flexibility, while classification-finetuning sharpens accuracy for targeted categorization tasks.
